# Contact_List
This is my first project that I am storing on github.
You can add, search, or delete contacts with this program. It uses a map to do so.
I have a preprocessor directive towards the top titled "#include DISPLAY_LIST". It is commented out
, but you can uncomment that in case you wanted to see the contact list as a whole after you input a 
command into to the program (tell the program that you want to either (a)dd, (s)earch, or (d)elete a 
contact. Play with the code all you want or give any feedback. Thanks for reading.
